# GPU Memory Comparison

This project provides an interactive visualization of different GPU memory types, comparing their latency, speed, and other characteristics. It aims to help users understand the differences between various memory technologies used in modern GPUs.

## Features

- Interactive comparison of multiple GPU memory types
- Visual representation of memory latency
- Comparison chart for different metrics (speed, latency, price per GB)
- Detailed table with key features and applications for each memory type
- Ability to toggle different memory types for comparison


## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gpu-memory-comparison.git
   cd gpu-memory-comparison
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Usage

- Use the toggle buttons to select which memory types you want to compare.
- The latency visualization shows the relative speed of different memory types.
- Use the dropdown menu in the chart section to switch between different comparison metrics.
- Hover over the chart bars for more detailed information.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Recharts for data visualization
- Tailwind CSS for styling
